    <p>I’m not able to express my feelings when I have seen you that day. I strongly wish I were a painter who can be able to paint that beautiful face. Without my knowledge I’m envying all the painters in the world as they only had great capability of freezing time and depicting beautiful moment much more immortal. Believe it or not there exists few things which can only be seen and felt, if you ever try to describe it then you would utterly fail. We need to invent new words to describe them. All of sudden if you see beautiful peacock opening its feathers when sun is taking day off and moon starting to show it’s domination. How can you describe it? Excellent .. is that word sufficient ? Beautiful….if you say beautiful you will be branded as so naïve and immature. Just like this, how can I describe the beautiful moments I shared with you that evening. I’m getting anger as I’m at loss of words which could match up to the beauty I’m seeing when I’m closing my eyes. I didn’t want to use the word “Love” as this word is being used by billions over million of years.</p>
